**Secure Data Transmission and Encryption System**

Welcome to the repository of a comprehensive project focusing on secure data transmission and encryption. The project encompasses the design and implementation of an electronic system with capabilities of data acquisition, encryption into a cipher, transmission to a different system, receiving a cipher, and decryption to render the original data. The project showcases the application of secure data transmission and encryption techniques in hardware security.
Project Overview

The project spans four essential domains:

1. Data Acquisition: The system harnesses a sound sensor to capture data. It employs real-time sound calibrations, such as dBA measurements, for accurate and continuous data acquisition akin to professional sound level meters. A temperature sensor operates parallel with the sound sensor to investigate countermeasures against side channels, hardware trojans, and fault injections.

2.  Encryption and Decryption Techniques: Initial encryption and decryption procedures employ encryption algorithms such as XOR and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA). The project utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and decryption to secure data transmission.

3. Hardware Security Considerations: Potential hardware security vulnerabilities are meticulously considered and addressed throughout the system's implementation. We explore and apply countermeasures to combat threats from side-channel attacks, hardware trojans, and fault injections.

4. Testing and Validation: The project includes a comprehensive plan for designing and executing test cases to validate the implemented system's functionality, security, and reliability.
